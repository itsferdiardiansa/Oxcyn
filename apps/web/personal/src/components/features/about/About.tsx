          Over the past 5+ years, I&apos;ve worked in various areas of digital
          company, including front-end development, and Web UI/UX. I&apos;m
          proud to have worn many hats. Fast-forward to today, and I&apos;ve had
          the privilege of building variety software for many start-up huge

          My main focus these days is building accessible user interfaces for
          any clients that I&apos;m working for. I most enjoy building software
          in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet â€” things that look
          good but are also built well under the hood.

          When I&apos;m not in front of the computer, I&apos;m usually playing
          console games, hanging out with friends, or wandering around the house
          looking for peace.
