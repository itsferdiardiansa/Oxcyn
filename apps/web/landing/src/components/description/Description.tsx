        As a software engineer, my expertise lies in crafting distinctive coding
        for digital products.
        <br />
        <br />
        I engaged in a lot of variety in the IT industry and completed
        translating a design into a good or high-performance product that
        matched business requirements.

        Outside of work, I do like learning another tech that I haven&apos;t
        drilled down.
